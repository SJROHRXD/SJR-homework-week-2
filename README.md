## Project Description
This is a portfolio created with the intent of showcasing [future] projects. It will someday be much much prettier.
The acceptance criteria:
  - Name, photo or avatar | Name is front and center âœ”
  - Links to sections about projects | Links in Nav redirect to sections âœ”
  - When clicked, link scrolls to corresponding section | Scroll works âœ”
  - Images enlarge / application images enlarges upon hover (larger in size than the others) | âš  somewhat works
  - Image links to deployed application *** I have none! *** | ðŸ›‘ no projects to deploy
  - They layout is responsive | âš  relatively 

## Design Notes // Known Issues
1. The flexboxes are somewhat broken, as they do not properly *move around* in relation to the Nav and the Contact Info sections
2. Internal links do not exactly land where I'd like them to, but struggled to assign them to an element or item or object or something that would create the desired effect
3. Background moves when hovering over images (why? why is this happening?)
4. CSS is rude.
5. Images do not link to deployed applications because I don't have any. For now, they are just stock photo placeholders.


## Technologies used
HTML, CSS, and lots of Google

## PLEASE NOTE ##
I am aware that the images and CSS and all of that are not in the preferred folder structure / order - however, when deploying, this kept breaking - despite me ensuring my paths were correct (relative) and all. Please forgive the mess! - SJR
